                <h3 id="about"> About Me</h3>
                <p>&emsp; I am Vennjy Lugo, A 19-year-old Filipino who is a sophomore at Ateneo
                    de Davao University studying computer engineering for the year 2023-2024. I 
                    started programming when I was 17 years old, though I mostly just fooled around 
                    at the time, not taking it seriously. But when I successfully ran my first program 
                    (it was a "hello world" written in python), I fell in love with programming. 
                    It was then when I confidently decided to myself, this is going to be my career. 
                    Afterwards it became my hobby. </p><br>
                
                <h3 id="webdev"> WebDev Journey</h3>
                <p></p>&emsp; I started to learn website development a year later, though its mostly 
                    front-end stuff. I scowered the internet for resources for learning HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript, then I applied my knowledge by creating dummy websites. I eventually 
                    stumbled upon bootstrap which saved me so much time for the looks and feel for my 
                    website, and thus I began using it frequently. Even now.
                    </p><br/> 
                    
                <h3 id="achievements"> Achievements</h3>
                <p>&emsp; I haven't really achieved anything much yet for I am still seeking glory. 
                    Aside from the developing websites, I have also developed mobile and desktop applications 
                    during my free time, and competed in a programming competition which was "ICPEP". 
                    In that competition, I luckily got champion in both division and regional levels, though 
                    not lucky enough to proceed to the national level because the location needed a plane 
                    flight and the university could not afford plane tickets.  </p><br>
                    
                <h3 id="competitive"> Competitive Programming</h3>
                <p>&emsp; I mostly specialize in Competitive programming with C++, and I am passionate in 
                    building applications, and developing websites. Here are my profiles in competitive programming.
